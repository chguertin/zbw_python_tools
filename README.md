================

just some stuff for maya


TO DO: 8/30/12
need to standardize function calls and all that. . .
#----- CHANGE NAME OF ALL MASTER FUNCTIONS TO MATCH THE NAME OF THE SCRIPT ITSELF

messageMapper: add scroll bar to UI, call back to UI window to resize (nonadjustable?), call to function shouldn't include "zbw_"

ribbon: make a proper ribbon rig :)

look in mel folder and redo bits of that into python . . .

******make generic window class for above^

script to take selected shaders and override the color, spec, ambient, etc for creating render layers?

anim tools - create UI for main module, create icons for each - fold in the outliers(pulldown)
