# select an object and capture it's initial values, these will be shown in a column (t, r, s). Then move that object around and capture the new values (these are in a second adjacent column). This will fill in an offset column. Then there's a button that will offset the curves for each attr, EXCEPT at that frame if there's a key there. You can then select another object and apply that same transformation. . . You can have option to enable the "offset" column and manually enter the offset values.
